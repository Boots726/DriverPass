# DriverPass

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass system is a desired training and scheduling program for the customer DriverPass. DriverPass wants to provide online training and practice examinations, and scheduling of on-the-road training to individuals preparing for DMV administered driving examinations. Attached are the Business Requirements Document which describes the requirements as laid out by DriverPass owner and IT Officer, as well as the System Design Document, which should be utilized by our team to assist in the creation of the initial iteration of the DriverPass system.

What did you do particularly well?

I believe that my diagrams are made really well. They are easy to understand, capture the key points, and are organized in a manner that would assist a team in creating the DriverPass system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the Platform Constraints portion of the Business Requirements Document. The rest of the document is laid out in bulleted form, while the Platform Constraints is not. To maintain formatting throughout the document, I would re-write that portion in a bulleted format.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

We utilized the interview transcript to gain an understanding of what the DriverPass company wanted out of their training and scheduling program. We have the ability to create the framework for their training platform, and can create the scheduler along with payment acceptance. By gaining an understanding of what was inportant to the client we ensure that we are meeting their expectations for the project they would like assistance with. When considering client needs, we need to remember that we are a service provider. We should do all that we can to ensure that the clients wants and needs are being met in order to guarantee that they seek our company out for future needs, and recommend us to other businesses.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I attack the problem. In order to do that, I need to have a good understanding of what the problem is to begin with. We can employ mulitple different strategies to analyze a system. For instance, we could communicate with stakeholders to gain an understanding of how they want the system to operate. We could observe day-to-day evolutions to determine how the current system is being utilized, and we can refer to technical documents to determine whether the system is currently being used as intended. With this information we will be able to provide a better overall service to the customer. After gathering information, we can begin in the system design. As I stated within the System Design Document, the first creation of a system design is the rough draft, with each subsequent iteration being more and more accurate and precise.
